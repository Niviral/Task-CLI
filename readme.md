### Feedback


+ \+ Error messages
+ \+ typing
+ \+ App works
+ \+ It's installable
+ \+ Using black
+ \+ Descriptive README
- \- Using click (I don't see this as negative hence Click was left as CLI framework)
- \- ~~Lack of success message when adding task~~ (Added in : #74bc90e)
- \- ~~Command "task list" returns empty table without any info, it's quite
    confusing that it's returning 
    something(empty table), not an error, but no tasks even after user added some.
    I think that some flag should be default when no params to command are given.~~ (Option `--all` set as default when no option specifed #74bc90e)
- \- ~~Some of the names are considered reserved, list is builtin function so 
  don't overwrite it~~ (No reserved names overwiten)
- \- ~~Importing using * is considered bad practice~~ (All imports changed to absolute #74bc90e)
- \- ~~Use only absolute imports~~ (All imports changed to absolute #74bc90e)
- \- ~~Avoid using one letter variable names~~ (No single letter variables #74bc90e)
- \- ~~It would be more elegant to not mix string formatting methods, I would suggest to use only f strings~~ (All formating performed with fstring #74bc90e)
- \- ~~It's better to use docstrings than comments above function and remember that comment need to contain 
    some additional information, don't add comments that are obvious therefore redundant~~ (Removed all redundant docstrings and comments #74bc90e)
- \- ~~You could reverse logic in db_check function so else won't be necessary~~ (db_check logic resolved on context manager level since #f7c7fb5)
- \- ~~Lack of .gitignore file~~ (.gitignore added #26b7b93)
- \- ~~Commits should have descriptive message which is not repeated~~ (descriptive commit message from #26b7b93 forward)
- \- ~~Lack of tests~~ (test for manager added #c68c825)
